WebApp accessible here: https://thatharshal.github.io/easy-english/
  
**Hey there!** Welcome to the "सीखो और बोलो" Easy English Learning WebApp! I created this web app to help my mom (and others like her) learn English in a fun and interactive way and ofcourse to learn and practice webdev. It’s designed specifically for Hindi-speaking parents who want to expand their English vocabulary and improve their sentence skills.

**What’s Inside?**  
- **Flashcards**: Learn new English words and sentences with handy flashcards that come with Hindi translations and pronunciations. Perfect for quick learning!
- **Random Fun**: Every time you click, you’ll get a fresh word and sentence. No boring repetition here!
- **Save Your Spot**: The app remembers where you left off, so you can jump right back into learning without missing a beat.
- **Easy Navigation**: Switch between the main menu and the word or sentence sections effortlessly.

**Tech Stuff**  
- **HTML**: The basic structure of the app is all about good old HTML5.
- **CSS**: I’ve styled it up with CSS for a sleek, dark theme that’s easy on the eyes.
- **JavaScript**: The magic happens here! JavaScript makes everything interactive, from random word generation to saving your progress.

**User Experience**  
The app is super user-friendly and made for Hindi speakers. You’ll find:
- A clean, easy-to-read layout.
- Flashcards that clearly show you the English word or sentence, along with its Hindi translation and pronunciation breakdown. Learning made easy!

**How to Use**  
1. Just open the app in your web browser.
2. Hit the "Next" button to see a random English word and sentence, complete with Hindi translations.
3. If you want to go back to the previous one, just click the "Back" button.
4. Enjoy learning at your own pace—no rush!
